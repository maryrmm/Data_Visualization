# datavisualization
This is where I save data I have compiled simply for my data visualization projects, especially ones where I didn't manipulate, transform or analyze the data via analytics tools.

My projects may be completed via Tableau, Flourish or PowerBI and posted on my LinkedIn or my portfolio website (coming soon).
